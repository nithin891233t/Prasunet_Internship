## Task 1: House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

### Problem Statement:
Develop a linear regression model to predict the prices of houses based on their square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms.

### Dataset:
- [House Prices Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)

### Key Features:
- Simple regression model
- Predicts house prices based on house features
- Evaluates model using mean squared error (MSE)

## Task 2: Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

### Problem Statement:
Create a K-Means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history.

### Dataset:
- [Customer Segmentation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python)

### Key Features:
- K-Means clustering for customer segmentation
- Identifies groups of similar customers based on purchase behavior
- Visualizes clusters and customer data distribution

## Task 3: Cat vs. Dog Image Classification using SVM

### Problem Statement:
Implement a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs.

### Dataset:
- [Dogs vs. Cats Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data)

### Key Features:
- SVM-based image classification
- Binary classification between two categories: cats and dogs
- Evaluates model accuracy on the test dataset

## Task 4: Food Recognition and Calorie Estimation

### Problem Statement:
Develop a model to accurately recognize food items from images and estimate their calorie content, enabling users to track their dietary intake.

### Dataset:
- [Food-101 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/food-101)

### Key Features:
- Image classification of food items
- Calorie estimation for dietary tracking
- Recognizes various food items and provides calorie per gram estimates

#### Calories per gram for each food item:
- Apple Pie: ~2.5 calories per gram
- Baby Back Ribs: ~3.5 calories per gram
- Baklava: ~5 calories per gram
- Beef Carpaccio: ~2 calories per gram

## How to Run the Projects

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/prasunet-internship-tasks.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the desired task folder:
    ```bash
    cd task_1   # For Task 1
    cd task_2   # For Task 2
    cd task_3   # For Task 3
    cd task_4   # For Task 4
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the corresponding Python script for each task.
